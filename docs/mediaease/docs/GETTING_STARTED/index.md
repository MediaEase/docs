# Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Operating System**: Fresh Debian 12 (Bookworm) server. More distributions support will come later.

> [!WARNING]
> If you want to set up a RAID array during the installation (yes, MediaEase can do it for you!), you may refer to the [Set Up a RAID Array](raid-setup.md) part.

[Continue to Installation](installation.md)
