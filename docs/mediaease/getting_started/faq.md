  <summary><strong>Why is the installation stuck at "Configuring Sendmail"?</strong></summary>

  **Answer:**
  It's common for the installation to appear to hang during the "Configuring Sendmail" step. This is part of the process, and the setup of Sendmail can take a few minutes, especially during the initial configuration phase.
  
  - **Why does this happen?**  
    Sendmail is a complex service, and its configuration requires some time to complete. This is expected behavior, and you donâ€™t need to worry unless the process takes an unusually long time.
  
  - **What should I do?**  
    Be patient and allow the configuration process to finish. No user interaction is required during this step, so simply wait for the process to complete. If it takes an unusually long time, ensure that your system resources and network connection are stable.

  <summary><strong>Why is the installation stuck at "Configuring HarmonyUI"?</strong></summary>

  **Answer:**
  The installation of HarmonyUI may appear to stall during its configuration due to the number of Composer (PHP) and Node.js dependencies it requires.

  - **Why does this happen?**  
    HarmonyUI relies on numerous dependencies to operate. Both PHP libraries via Composer and Node.js packages are installed during this step, which can take time depending on your network speed and system performance.
  
  - **What to expect:**  
    It's perfectly normal for this process to take a few minutes or more, depending on the speed of your system and internet connection. No interaction is necessary; just allow the dependencies to install. If the process takes significantly longer, you may want to verify your system's resource availability and network stability.
