- `-d $domain`: Sets the domain name.
- `--lang $lang`: Sets the language.
- `-vs $vault_salt`: Sets the vault salt.
- `-b $branch`: Sets the branch for installation (e.g., **main**, **beta**).
- `--verbose`: Enables verbose mode.
- `--no-lock`: Skips the generation of a Metapackage.
- `--no-reboot`: Disables automatic reboot at the end of installation.

### Complete Command Example

```bash
username="john"
password="superpassword"
email="test@me.com"
ports="4747,5757"
raid="0,ext4,/home,md10"
domain="mediaease.io"
lang="en"
vault_salt="youllneverguessit"

./setup.sh -u $username -p $password -e $email --ports $ports --raid $raid -d $domain --lang $lang -vs $vault_salt --no-lock --no-reboot --hostname mediaease-server --bypass-prompt --verbose
```

### Notes

- **Metapackage Generation**: By default, MediaEase will generate a Metapackage to lock installed dependencies. You can skip this by using the `--no-lock` flag if you're confident in your package management.
  
- **Reboot**: MediaEase will prompt you to reboot after the installation. You can skip this with the `--no-reboot` flag, but itâ€™s recommended to reboot to ensure all changes are applied.

### Permissions

Ensure that the `setup.sh` script is executable before running the installation. If not, make it executable with:

```bash
chmod +x setup.sh
```

By following this guide, you can easily customize and execute the `setup.sh` script according to your needs.
